OrbitHost addresses these challenges through a hybrid architecture that combines proven hosting technologies with AI-native features:

1. **Seamless AI Integration**: Built-in webhooks and APIs designed specifically for AI agent interaction
2. **Automated Insights**: Real-time capture and analysis of deployment performance and user interactions
3. **Intelligent Optimization**: AI-powered recommendations for improving performance and user experience
4. **Frictionless Deployment**: GitHub-based deployment with intelligent error detection and resolution

## Architecture

OrbitHost employs a hybrid architecture that balances open-source sharing with proprietary features:

### Core Components (Open Source)

1. **Webhook Listener**: Receives GitHub events and triggers deployments
2. **Deployment Engine**: Manages the build and deployment process
3. **Screenshot and DOM Capture**: Creates visual and structural snapshots of deployments
4. **Basic Documentation**: Guides and examples for core functionality

### Premium Components (Proprietary)

1. **Custom Domain Management**: Registration, DNS configuration, and SSL provisioning
2. **Billing Integration**: Subscription management and payment processing
3. **AI Integration Layer**: Specialized APIs and webhooks for AI agent interaction
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed insights into deployment performance and user behavior

### Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for performance and ease of development
- **Authentication**: Clerk.dev for secure user management
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for reliable data storage
- **Infrastructure**: Fly.io for scalable deployment
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface
- **Monitoring**: Phased approach with Prometheus, Zap, OpenTelemetry, and Grafana

## Key Features
